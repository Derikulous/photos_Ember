<b> This tutorial app is created from [embersherpa](http://embersherpa.com/articles/crud-example-app-without-ember-data/). </b>

<b> NOTE:</b> Ember-data is not being used, we are creating separate AJAX calls.

To get started with Ember, the following is needed:

1. jQuery

2. Ember.js [code found here](http://emberjs.com/builds/#/release)

3. Handlebars [code found here](http://handlebarsjs.com/)

4. optional: Ember-Data. With the release of a stable Ember-data beta 1.0 in August 2013, we can consider using it in the future to add user functionality.
